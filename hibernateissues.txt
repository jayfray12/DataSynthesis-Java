If you look at the RefdataTimezonesEntityhbm.xml on line 18 here:
https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/DataSynthesis-Java/blob/master/src/main/resources/RefdataTimezonesEntityhbm.xml#L18
You'll notice you are defining a property with a Column name of StatusID.  Yet on line 21 here:
https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/DataSynthesis-Java/blob/master/src/main/resources/RefdataTimezonesEntityhbm.xml#L21
Your doing a many-to-one relationship using the column StatusID.  If you are going to do the many-to-one (which I suggest because it keeps the relationship) then you don't need the StatusID property defined unless that StatusID is different in which case you'd need to change the column name.

This happens again in RefdataOrganizationEntityhbm.xml on line 27:
https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/DataSynthesis-Java/blob/master/src/main/resources/RefdataOrganizationEntityhbm.xml#L27
Where you have a property defined for StateID but on line 45:
https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/DataSynthesis-Java/blob/master/src/main/resources/RefdataOrganizationEntityhbm.xml#L45
You have a many-to-one defined for column name StateID.
If you look on line 36 and 48 of this same file you see the same issue with StatusID as we did above in the Timezones file
If you go through all the files looking for duplicate column names for the many-to-one and fix them then you should be golden
If you need further explanation or assistance with this let me know

Thanks for this. Let me take a look later. Tweaked my back from not wearing the right shoes in the hills of NC - duh!!!
When you did this did it resolve the issue and enable you to run?

Bummer on you back.  I hope you get to feeling better.
I fixed those 2 and kept running into the same issues in other files
You said you wanted to take it on so that's why I stopped
I'd be more than happy to continue on if you want me to
